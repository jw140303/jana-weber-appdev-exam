# Jana Weber App Development Exam project

This repository includes all the files for my App Development exam project.

It includes a short report, as well as the files needed to run the MVP.
An MVP is a "Minimum Viable Product". This means that the app is a prototype containing the essential features.
The MVP can be started in the browser of your choice using the link below. 

## Instructions to run and use my app
1. Open my streamlit app in your browser.
